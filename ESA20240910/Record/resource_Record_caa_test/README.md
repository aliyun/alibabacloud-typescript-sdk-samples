#### Project Overview
This project is a complete engineering example for "creating records" under the Record resource of the Alibaba Cloud product ESA (version: 2024-09-10). This example demonstrates how to:
- Create, update, and delete records.

#### Important Notes
- **Operation Costs**:
  - Running the sample code may incur costs for online resource operations on the current account. Please operate with caution!

- **Dependencies**:
  - The resource [Record] depends on the resource [Site], so you must successfully create a site before creating a record.
  - The resource [Site] depends on the resource [Plan], so you need to successfully purchase a plan before creating a site.

- **Asynchronous Operations**:
  - Purchasing a new plan, creating a site, creating a record, updating a record, and deleting a record are all asynchronous operations. You need to wait for their status to update to the specified state before proceeding to the next step.

#### Workflow
1. **Initialize Client**
   - To run this example, you must first configure your credentials as described in [Credential Configuration](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/sdk/developer-reference/v2-manage-net-access-credentials). Create a client instance.

2. **Purchase Plan**
   - Call the [PurchaseRatePlan](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/PurchaseRatePlan) interface to purchase a new resource plan and wait for its status to change to "running".

3. **Create Site**
   - After successfully purchasing a plan, call the [CreateSite](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/CreateSite) interface to create a new site and wait for its status to change to "pending".

4. **Create DNS Record**
   - After the site is successfully created, call the [CreateRecord](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/CreateRecord) interface to create a CAA type DNS record. This operation may encounter "Site.ServiceBusy" or "TooManyRequests" errors, and will be retried until it succeeds.

5. **Update DNS Record**
   - Call the [UpdateRecord](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/UpdateRecord) interface to update the created DNS record until it succeeds. This operation may encounter "TooManyRequests" or "Record.ServiceBusy" errors, and will be retried until it succeeds.

6. **Delete DNS Record**
   - Finally, call the [DeleteRecord](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/DeleteRecord) interface to delete the previously created DNS record until it succeeds, completing the entire lifecycle management. This operation may encounter "TooManyRequests" or "Record.ServiceBusy" errors, and will be retried until it succeeds.

#### How to Run
