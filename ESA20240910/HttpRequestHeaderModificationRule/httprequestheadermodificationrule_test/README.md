#### Project Overview
This project is a complete engineering example for "creating, updating, and deleting HTTP request header modification rules" under the HttpRequestHeaderModificationRule resource of the Alibaba Cloud product ESA (version: 2024-09-10). This example demonstrates how to:
- Create an HTTP request header modification rule.
- Update an already created HTTP request header modification rule.
- Delete an already created HTTP request header modification rule.

#### Important Notes
- **Operation Costs**:
  - Running the sample code may incur costs for online resource operations on the current account. Please proceed with caution!

- **Dependencies**:
  - The resource `HttpRequestHeaderModificationRule` depends on the `Site` resource, so you must successfully create a site before creating an HTTP request header modification rule.
  - The `Site` resource depends on the `RatePlanInstance` resource, so you need to successfully purchase a plan before creating a site.

- **Asynchronous Operations**:
  - Purchasing a new plan and creating a site are both asynchronous operations. You need to wait for their status to update to the specified state before proceeding to the next step.

#### Workflow
1. **Initialize the Client**
   - To run this example, you must first configure your credentials as described in [Credential Configuration](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/sdk/developer-reference/v2-manage-net-access-credentials). Create a client instance.
   
2. **Purchase a Plan**
   - Call the [PurchaseRatePlan](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/PurchaseRatePlan) API to purchase a new resource plan and wait for its status to change to "running".

3. **Create a Site**
   - After successfully purchasing a plan, call the [CreateSite](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/CreateSite) API to create a new site and wait for its status to change to "pending".

4. **Create an HTTP Request Header Modification Rule**
   - After the site is successfully created, call the [CreateHttpRequestHeaderModificationRule](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/CreateHttpRequestHeaderModificationRule) API to create an HTTP request header modification rule.

5. **Update an HTTP Request Header Modification Rule**
   - Call the [UpdateHttpRequestHeaderModificationRule](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/UpdateHttpRequestHeaderModificationRule) API to update the already created HTTP request header modification rule until the update is successful.

6. **Delete an HTTP Request Header Modification Rule**
   - Finally, call the [DeleteHttpRequestHeaderModificationRule](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/DeleteHttpRequestHeaderModificationRule) API to delete the previously created HTTP request header modification rule until the deletion is successful, completing the entire lifecycle management.

#### How to Run
