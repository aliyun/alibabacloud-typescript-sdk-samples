#### Project Overview
This project is a complete engineering example for creating client certificates under the ClientCertificate resource of Alibaba Cloud's ESA (version: 2024-09-10) service. This example demonstrates how to:
- Create, update, and delete client certificates.
- Manage the lifecycle of client certificates, including activation and revocation.

#### Notes
- **Operation Costs**:
  - Running the sample code may incur costs for online resource operations on the current account. Please proceed with caution!

- **Dependencies**:
  - The resource [Client Certificate] depends on the [Site] resource, so you must successfully create a site before creating a client certificate.
  - The [Site] resource depends on the [Rate Plan] resource, so you need to successfully purchase a rate plan before creating a site.

- **Asynchronous Operations**:
  - Purchasing a new rate plan and creating a site are both asynchronous operations. You must wait for their status to update to the specified state before proceeding to the next step.

#### Workflow
1. **Initialize the Client**
   - To run this example, you must first configure your credentials as described in [Credential Configuration](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/sdk/developer-reference/v2-manage-net-access-credentials). Create a client instance.

2. **Purchase a New Rate Plan**
   - Call the [PurchaseRatePlan](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/PurchaseRatePlan) API to purchase a new rate plan and wait for its status to change to "running".

3. **Create a Site**
   - After successfully purchasing the rate plan, call the [CreateSite](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/CreateSite) API to create a new site and wait for its status to change to "pending".

4. **Create a Client Certificate**
   - After the site is successfully created, call the [CreateClientCertificate](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/CreateClientCertificate) API to create a new client certificate.

5. **Update a Client Certificate**
   - Call the [RevokeClientCertificate](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/RevokeClientCertificate) API to revoke the created client certificate.
   - Call the [ActivateClientCertificate](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/ActivateClientCertificate) API to activate the created client certificate.
   - Call the [RevokeClientCertificate](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/RevokeClientCertificate) API again to revoke the created client certificate.

6. **Delete a Client Certificate**
   - Finally, call the [DeleteClientCertificate](https://api.aliyun.com/api/ESA/2024-09-10/DeleteClientCertificate) API to delete the previously created client certificate, completing the entire lifecycle management.
